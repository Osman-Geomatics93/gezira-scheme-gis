## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for new frontend code
- Follow ES6+ standards
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Max line length: 120 characters
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays

Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Fetches sectors by division
 * @param division - The division name (East, West, North, South)
 * @returns Promise with sector data
 */
export async function getSectorsByDivision(division: string): Promise<SectorData> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow the file structure: `ComponentName/ComponentName.tsx`

Example:
```typescript
interface SectorCardProps {
  sector: Sector;
  onSelect: (id: number) => void;
}

export const SectorCard: React.FC<SectorCardProps> = ({ sector, onSelect }) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### CSS/Tailwind

- Use Tailwind utility classes when possible
- Keep custom CSS minimal
- Use meaningful class names for custom CSS
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

- Use async/await over callbacks
- Handle errors properly
- Validate inputs
- Use meaningful HTTP status codes
- Add comments for complex logic

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples:
```
feat(map): add drawing tools for creating new sectors

fix(auth): resolve JWT token expiration issue

docs(readme): update installation instructions

refactor(api): simplify sector query logic
```

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Run `npm test` before submitting PR
- Aim for good test coverage

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run linter
npm run lint
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
